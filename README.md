# hangman

This is an old piece of code I wrote a couple years ago. The context behind it is that a friend of mine was teaching an introductory computer science course and, just as a bit of fun, challenged me to write a functional hangman code as fast as possible.
I was quite content with it, since it handled non-alphanumeric characters in a way that I liked, allowed the user to input the target word, displayed previous guesses, was case insensitive, and prevented guessing duplicate or non-alphabetic characters, and even allowed for multiple games.
Despite this, it is certainly not the most efficient way to handle the problem; if I were to sit down and implement hangman in a manner that was intended to be more serious and not doing so as fast as possible to goof off, I would change a lot of the code for efficiency.
Similarly, as a result of the circumstances that this was written in, it doesn't match best practices/good style.
